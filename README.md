# Java IV Spring JDBC Lab

Completing this lab demonstrates your ability to code interact with the database using
the Spring Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) template.


## Objective

Implement all methods in [BookShopRepository](src/main/java/edu/cscc/java4/data/BookShopRepository.java) so that all 
tests in [BookShopRepositoryTests](src/test/java/edu/cscc/java4/data/BookShopRepositoryTests.java) pass. As noted
in the lecture videos, there are lots of ways to make it work but simple is better and less code is better

## Getting Started:

1. Copy the starter code from here into a new, private repository in your personal GitHub account using [these instructions](https://github.com/jeff-anderson-cscc/submitting-assignments-lab#copy-the-starter-code-into-a-new-private-repository-in-your-personal-github-account) substituting this repository URL ``https://github.com/jeff-anderson-cscc/java4-labs-spring-jdbc.git`` for the one referenced in that document
2. Create a new branch for your code changes as described in [these instructions](https://github.com/jeff-anderson-cscc/submitting-assignments-lab#before-you-start-coding)


## Completing the Assignment

__Important__ You may not change the code in any test cases. _The only permissible difference between the base version of the JUnit test class and yours is yours will have no tests commented out and the file is otherwise identical._

1. Open [BookShopRepositoryTests](src/test/java/edu/cscc/java4/data/BookShopRepositoryTests.java)
1. For each test, add just enough code in [BookShopRepository](src/main/java/edu/cscc/java4/data/BookShopRepository.java) to make the test pass
1. Once all tests are passing, commit your changes

**Hint:** Notice the import statements in [BookShopRepository](src/main/java/edu/cscc/java4/data/BookShopRepository.java). I left a few initially unused imports in there to guide your solution
